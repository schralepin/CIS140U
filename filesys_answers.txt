Part I, answer these questions in a text file. Using vim here would be good practice for you.

is: /home/students/max/homeworks/lab1. Also, the user's login name is max and this is also his home directory.
 What is the full pathname of the current working directory after each cd has been performed:
    a) cd ~
/home/students/max
    b) cd .
/home/students/max
    c) cd ..
/home/student
NOTE: Assume that the current working directory is always /home/students/max/homeworks/lab1 for each problem separately.
