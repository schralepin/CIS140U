find /home/student/aaron.brock1/findassign -cmin -1440

possibly
-find /home/student/aaron.brock1/findassign -mtime -1 -ls
Test this tomorrow after 11 am. modify one file to check

find . -mtime 0 -printf '%T+\t%s\t%p\n' 2>/dev/null | sort -r | more
This will list files and directories that have been 
modified in the last 24 hours (-mtime 0). It will list 
them with the last modified time in a format that is both
 sortable and human-readable (%T+), followed by the file 
size (%s), followed by the full filename (%p), each 
separated by tabs (\t).

2>/dev/null throws away any stderr output, so that error 
messages don't muddy the waters; sort -r sorts the results
 by most recently modified first; and | more lists one
 page of results at a time.

1. find . -mtime +1 -ls

2. find . -name '[aeiou]???????' -print

3. find . -type l

4. find . -mtime +365 -exec mv {} {}OLD \;

Which command below will search for the files
 that start with 'an' in the current directory and then 
display the contents of the file?

find . -name 'an*' -type f -exec cat {} \;

5. find . -type f -perm 222 -print

6. find . -executable -type f -printf '%s %p\n' |sort -n -r | head

7. find . -perm 777 -type f -printf '%s %p\n' |sort -n -r | head


8.To view a breakdown of inode usage for all directories 
located in the current directory
find . -printf "%h\n" | cut -d/ -f-2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

*find . | ls -li | sort -rn
