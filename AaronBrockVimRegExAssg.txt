Questions
NOTE: I will be doing your given substitution commands with the file 
astro.txt to see if they work correctly. Note that there may be several 
ways to do some of these tasks with the substitution command. I will take
 it if it is a valid substitution command that does exactly what the 
question asks for.

HINT: It might be useful to use the c flag to step through what the 
substitute command is doing. Also, remember to use the key stroke u to 
undo back to the original file.

1.
In lines 80 to 101, replace the words Jupiter, Saturn or Earth with a hash mark (#).
:80,101s/\v(Jupiter)|(Saturn)|(Earth)/#/g ,u

2.
In line 37, change everything that is not a vowel to a question mark (?).
37G, :37s/\v[^aeiou]/?/gi , u

3.
Break all lines in the file into lines less than or equal to 41 characters.
HINT: Try using a fixed quantifier. Also note that all lines in this file are 80 or
 less so there shouldn't be a need to break them more than once.
:%s/\v(.{41})/\1\r/g , u

4.
Now do the previous question but try to break lines where the spaces are instead of 
in the middle of a word. The lines won't be exactly 41 characters but should be at 
least 41 in size and only large enough to not split a word.
HINT: Use back referencing to get the letters/numbers before a space and then after 
a space.
:%s/\v(.{41} )/\1\r/g ,u

5.
In all lines, remove the comma (,) inside all numbers. NOTE: All numbers with commas
 have groups of 3 or less numbers surrounding them. There are no numbers with more
 than one comma.
:%s/\v([0-9]{1,})(,)/\1/g ,u
